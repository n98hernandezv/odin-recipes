        <p>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with sauces and fillings. The classic version features alternating layers of pasta, rich Bolognese sauce made with meat, tomatoes, and spices, and creamy béchamel sauce. Each layer is topped with cheese—often mozzarella or Parmesan—and baked until the top is golden and bubbling. Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region, lasagna has become a beloved comfort food worldwide.</p>
        <p>Beyond the classic recipe, lasagna has evolved into countless variations to suit different tastes and dietary needs. Vegetarian versions may include spinach, zucchini, or eggplant, while others swap beef for chicken, seafood, or plant-based proteins. There are also gluten-free and vegan adaptations. Its appeal lies in the balance of textures—the tender pasta, the creamy sauces, and the crispy, cheesy crust—making it a favorite for family gatherings and restaurant menus alike.</p>
