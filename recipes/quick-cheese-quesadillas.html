        <p>Quesadillas are a simple yet satisfying dish with roots in Mexican cuisine, traditionally made by filling a tortilla with cheese and other ingredients before cooking it until the tortilla is golden and the cheese is melted. They’re incredibly versatile—you can keep them minimal with just cheese, or add vegetables, meats, beans, or herbs for extra flavor and texture. The beauty of a quesadilla lies in its balance: the crisp exterior contrasts with the gooey, savory filling, making it a comforting option for any time of day.</p>
        <p>Over time, quesadillas have become popular far beyond Mexico, adapting to local tastes and ingredients. They can be made with flour or corn tortillas, cooked on a skillet, griddle, or even baked, and served with sides like salsa, guacamole, or sour cream. Quick to prepare and endlessly customizable, they’re perfect for a light lunch, a snack, or a casual dinner. Whether enjoyed plain or loaded with extras, quesadillas deliver big flavor with minimal effort.</p>
